# LinkedListPalindrome.java
An algorithm that determines whether a given linked list is a palindrome (a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward) or not. Time complexity of the method of O(n).

A stack is used to record the first half of the word/phrase in reversed order to then compare the value that is popped off the stack with the second half of the word/phrase.

Change the given linked list in the main method by creating a node with the first letter of the word/phrase then appending subsequent letters, numbers, or spaces in a String type.
